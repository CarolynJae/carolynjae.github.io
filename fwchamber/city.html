            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The fertile, game-rich land surrounding the banks of the Trinity River 
              had long been a favorite hunting ground for Native Americans in the area, 
              but it soon proved irresistible to settlers as well.<br>

              A settlement had been established by Jonathon Bird in the winter of 1840, 
              three miles east of where Birdville is today. In 1843, Sam Houston came to 
              what was then called Fort Bird or Bird’s Fort and remained more than a 
              month, awaiting chiefs from different tribes to discuss a peace parley. 
              Houston departed, leaving Gen. Edward H. Tarrant and George W. Terrell to 
              meet with the chiefs. When the tribes came to the negotiating table, a 
              treaty was made under which the Native Americans were to remain to the west 
              of a line traced passing through the future site of Fort Worth. The line 
              marked “Where the West Begins” — giving Fort Worth its famous slogan.<br>
