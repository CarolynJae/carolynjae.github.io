          on the website after they finish their lessons for the day.  Melanie is also the 
          Park Day coordinator for her local homeschool group and uses the website to plan

          <p>Janie Storm is a 17-year-old High School student at the local high school.  She is
            absolutely fascinated with everything related to the weather and wants to be 
            a meteorologist when she grows up.  Janie uses the website to learn everything 
            she can about meteorology and likes to keep track of the weather every day so she 
            can practice doing weather forecasts. Sometimes, just for fun, she likes to go 
            out in bad weather and pretend she is giving live weather updates. </p>
